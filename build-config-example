# This is the raspberry pi kernel builder configuration
# Please copy this file rename it to build-config and adjust the vales to your needs.

#
# Set the raspberry pi hardware model. This has to be an integer between 1 to 5, designating
# the underlying Pi hardware. There are no differences between normal and + (plus) versions
# like B and B+. The RPi Zero is 1, Zero 2 is 2.
#
MODEL=2

#
# Set to 32 or 64 in order to compile a 32 or 64 bit version of the kernel.
# Note that not all architectures are available depending on the MODEL set above
# E. g., there's no 64 bit kernel for hardware < 3. an no 32 bit kernel for the Pi 5
# The build will fail on any illeagal combinations
#
BIT_WIDTH=32

#
# Set the git hash, branch or tag of the commit to be built. At the time of this writing
# there's a git tag carrying the date given in 'uname -a'
#
GIT_REF=stable_20250916

#
# Set the kernel version. This is the number indicated after the hashtag in 'uname -a'
# E. g., ... #1 -> 1
#
VERSION=1

#
# Override the number of cores to use in compilation. If unset the number of cores is determined automatically and
# set to the maximum number of cores available ('nproc')
#
#CORES=1
